### Fixed

- [#5](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-composer-autoloading/pull/5) fixes how
  the command creates the path to the module source directory; previously, it
  was hard-coded, and did not take into account the `-p`/`--modules-path`
  argument created in [#2](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-composer-autoloading/pull/2).

- [#6](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-composer-autoloading/pull/6) adds
  validation for the number of arguments, ensuring that no flags have empty
  values.

- [#7](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-composer-autoloading/pull/7) adds
  validation of the composer binary in a cross-platform way; an exception is
  now raised if it is not executable.

## 1.1.0 - 2017-02-16

### Added

- [#2](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-composer-autoloading/pull/2) adds the

  holding the module/source tree for which autoloading will be provided.
