# Wildcard Listeners

Sometimes you'll want to attach the same listener to all events of a given
instance â€” or potentially, with a shared event collection, all contexts.

## Attaching using the wildcard

To attach to all events on a given `EventManager` instance, you can use the
wildcard event, `*`:

```php
$events = new EventManager();
$events->attach('*', $listener);
```

Note that if you specify a priority, that priority will be used for this
listener for any event triggered.

What the above specifies is that **any** event triggered by the event manager
instance will result in notification of this particular listener.

## Attaching using the wildcard via a SharedEventManager

Using the `SharedEventManager`, you can indicate that you want to attach to all
events of a given identifier, a single named event across all identifiers, or
all events on all identifiers.

```php
$sharedEvents = new SharedEventManager();

// Attach to all events on the context "foo"
$sharedEvents->attach('foo', '*', $listener);

// Attach to the "foo" event of any context:
$sharedEvents->attach('*', 'foo', $listener);

// Attach to all events on all contexts:
$sharedEvents->attach('*', '*', $listener);
```

Note that if you specify a priority, that priority will be used for all events
specified.
