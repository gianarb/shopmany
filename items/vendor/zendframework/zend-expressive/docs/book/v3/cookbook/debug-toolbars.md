# How can I get a debug toolbar for my Expressive application?

Many modern frameworks and applications provide debug toolbars: in-browser
toolbars to provide profiling information of the request executed. These can
provide invaluable details into application objects, database queries, and more.
As an Expressive user, how can you get similar functionality?

## Zend Server Z-Ray

[Zend Server](http://www.zend.com/en/products/zend_server) ships with a tool
called [Z-Ray](http://www.zend.com/en/products/server/z-ray), which provides
both a debug toolbar and debug console (for API debugging). Z-Ray is also
currently [available as a standalone technology
preview](http://www.zend.com/en/products/z-ray/z-ray-preview), and can be added
as an extension to an existing PHP installation.

When using Zend Server or the standalone Z-Ray, you do not need to make any
changes to your application whatsoever to benefit from it; you simply need to
make sure Z-Ray is enabled and/or that you've setup a security token to
selectively enable it on-demand. See the
[Z-Ray documentation](http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Server/content/z-ray_concept.htm)
for full usage details.

## php-middleware/php-debug-bar

[php-middleware/php-debug-bar](https://github.com/php-middleware/phpdebugbar)
provides a PSR-15 middleware wrapper around [maximebf/php-debugbar](https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar),
a popular framework-agnostic debug bar for PHP projects.

First, install the middleware in your application:

```bash
$ composer require php-middleware/php-debug-bar
```

This package supplies a config provider, which could be added to your
`config/config.php` when using zend-config-aggregator or
expressive-config-manager. However, because it should only be enabled in
development, we recommend creating a "local" configuration file (e.g.,
`config/autoload/php-debugbar.local.php`) when you need to enable it, with the
following contents:

```php
<?php
use PhpMiddleware\PhpDebugBar\ConfigProvider;

$provider = new ConfigProvider();
return $provider();
```

> ### Use locally!
>
> Remember to enable `PhpMiddleware\PhpDebugBar\ConfigProvider` only in your
> development environments!
